The following task show be review
1. the paralle method in matlab
2. The transition function 

## Finished
1. Question 2 stationary distribution of given price 
2. compute the K^New and L^New given inital guess of K0 and L0+

The K0 = 1.9957 L0 = 0.3020
wage is 1.2240, interest rate is 0.0537 
K0 = 1.8215 
L0 = 0.3011
## Todo
2. try to put dynamic programing and stationary distribution into function space.
3. try to figure it how the bocast variable and know how to improve the speed.
